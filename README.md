# InfosecMindmaps

## Log4Shell
3 mindmaps designed to help mitigating / protecting against the Log4shell vulnerability (lots of CVEs now...) :
* Mind map #1 : Decision tree to identify if the code in-use is vulnerable
* Mind map #2 : How to detect the vulnerability, from the black box or white box perspective
* Mind map #3 : Shielding & mitigations against Log4shell : Patching is one thing, but defence in depth is advised. A few pointers in this mind map can help.
